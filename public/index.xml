      <description>In this part, we will be exploring branching. In the previous lesson, we learned how to upload our work to GitHub, but what if we are in a team where each member is in a different place in a different machine and where we have to edit the same project lots of time. In order to maintain a good collaboration among the team members and dividing their work individually to complete, branching comes in handy.</description>

      <description>GitHub provides you the chance to host your website via username.github.io domain. But if you have a custom domain then you can also configure that with GitHub. Today, I&amp;rsquo;m about to show you how you can add your Namecheap domain to GitHub. If you have not any Namecheap domain then you certainly can have for free like I got. Just apply to GitHub student dev pack and grab one. Okay, first thing first.</description>

      <description>Welcome back to Part 2 of the GitHub series. Now, we create a text file named index.txt and add a line in the text file for example print(“hello!”). Now perform the previous command again: 
git status  After this command, It will display some message stating untracked files meaning that some changes have been made to this folder which is not tracked by git yet and it is red marked.</description>
